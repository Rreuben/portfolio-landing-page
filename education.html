      <p>I have done 8-4-4 but only till class 8. After that I moved to an Accelerated Christian Education for about 3 years. I then started homeschooling the year after due to some risen financial issues.
      I now do coding with Moringa School to further brighten my future.</p>

      <p class="description">My current education is coding. Coding is what makes it possible for us to create computer software, apps and websites. Your browser, your OS, the apps on your phone, Facebook, and many more websites – they’re all made with code.</p>
