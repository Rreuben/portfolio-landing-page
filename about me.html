      <p>I am Reuben, age 18, from Nairobi, Kenya. I study coding and practice it on the daily. I first started off with 8-4-4 and by class 8 I moved to an Accelerated Christian Education. I studied there for about 4 years and started homeschooling the year after due to risen financial issues.</p>

    <h2 class="title2">Personal Information</h2>
    <p class="description">Reason for learning programming.</p>
    <p>I've always been interested in programming and coding. I believe it opens doors to another world in which there are no limits. I feel like I'll be able to apply my coding knowledge to other fields such as Sound Engineering & Design, Photo Editing & Design and many more.</p>
    <h2 class="title2">Extra-Curricular Activities</h2>
    <p class="description">These are two of my activities out of school:</p>
      <ul>

        <li class="eca">Photo Design</li>
        <p class="description">I work with tools like Adobe Photoshop to edit photos and make them unreal. I am, however still in the learning stage.</p>
