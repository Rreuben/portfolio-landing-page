      <h3 class="title">Coding</h3>
      <p class="description">My current education is coding. Coding is what makes it possible for us to create computer software, apps and websites. Your browser, your OS, the apps on your phone, Facebook, and many more websites – they’re all made with code.</p>

      <h2 class="title2">Personal Information</h2>
      <p class="description">Reason for learning programming.</p>
      <p>I've always been interested in programming and coding. I believe it opens doors to another world in which there are no limits. I feel like I'll be able to apply my coding knowledge to other fields such as Sound Engineering & Design, Photo Editing & Design and many more.</p>
